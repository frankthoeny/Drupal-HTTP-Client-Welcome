My Drupal 8 custom module requires the Drupal 8 contributed module HTTP Client Manager.

## JS Libraries and Frameworks
~~Using Bootstrap 4, Popper and Font Awesome. JQuery is still provided in Drupal 8/9.~~ 
Currently, no need for JS, but can implement in the Yaml libraries and Twig theme.

## CSS Styling
~~Styling with Bootstrap not modified.~~
Using plain vanilla CSS for styling, but can implement in Yaml libraries.

## Twig Templating Engine
Front end Built with HTML and Twig.
